					<h2><span class="ahn">AhnLab</span>  MDSE</h2>
					<p class="sub">A leading-edge endpoint threat analysis and response solution with real-time visibility <br /><br /></p>
					<p class="firstParagraph">In the endpoint systems of businesses, a large number of files are created, distributed or flow from the outside. However, traditional security methods at endpoints such as signature-based solutions and blacklist or whitelist solutions are no longer effective to monitor and manage these numerous files and their behaviors. There are some areas with no visibility at endpoints due to these unmanageable files and more advanced or sophisticated cyber-attacks have targeted these blind areas to penetrate businessesâ€™ networks. That is why businesses are required to implement advanced endpoint security methods to have full visibility into all endpoints.</p>
					<p class="pt20"><strong>AhnLab MDSE</strong> (Malware Defense System for Enterprise) is the leading-edge endpoint threat analysis and response solution that offers real-time visibility by performing a full inspection of files across all endpoints. It provides real-time visibility and prompt responses to unknown threats by performing a full inspection on all endpoints.<br /></p>
