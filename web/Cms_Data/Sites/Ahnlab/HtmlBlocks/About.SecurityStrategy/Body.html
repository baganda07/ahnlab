<h3 class="cTit">Brand-new Multi-layered Security: New Perspective on Advanced Cyber Threat Defense</h3>
<p class="mt5">Today&rsquo;s advanced attacks originate from multiple vectors, which leave traditional point-solution countermeasures incapable of mitigating them. These targeted attacks, which are called advanced persistent threats (APTs), require immediate, automated mitigation.</p>
<p>Simply detecting malware, however, is no longer sufficient to cope with the multi-stage attacks of advanced malware since Malware used in APTs is not universal but rather specially designed to penetrate a targeted organization&rsquo;s network. As a result, current security strategies require more advanced defense elements than ever before.</p>
<p>To ensure security measures cover the advanced threats, it is mandatory to coordinate existing defense systems with an overall security strategy. To address that AhnLab introduced a new, next-generation security strategy to defend against advanced threats: multi-layered security strategy.</p>
<p>The brand-new multi-layered security strategy has four layers:</p>
